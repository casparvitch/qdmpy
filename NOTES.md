Notes
=====

- Check previous project (flti etc.) to see proper code structure
- Don't have 'use_ROI_for_fit' option



Feature Requests
================

- [ ] Don't just fit full ROI, fit Area 1/2 as well. 
- [x] Have fit regions etc. be scaled to the binning (so we don't have to recalculate each time... or perhaps as another option.) Nah bad idea
- [ ] Net binning option -> reads previous binning, does the necessary conversion (checks it works etc.)


- [ ] Need to provide option to use init_guess (etc.) on all pixels, or to use ROI_avg_result
	- can compare in AOI fits...

- [ ] code profiling!

- [ ] an additional script to compare the spectra (AOI or ROI) in two different images? Not just a subtraction thing...

- [ ] select AOI or even ROI with cursor box etc.
