Notes
=====

- Check previous project (flti etc.) to see proper code structure



Feature Requests
================

- [ ] Don't just fit full ROI, fit Area 1/2 as well. 
- [ ] Have fit regions etc. be scaled to the binning (so we don't have to recalculate each time... or perhaps as another option.)
- [ ] Total binning option -> reads previous binning, does the necessary conversion (checks it works etc.)
